    <h1>About Me :</h1>
    <img src="../assets/images/moives_images/IMG_20251009_224322.jpg"width="200">
    <p>I am Thunder.emperor.366 who refuses to settle for mediocrity. He’s driven by a deep curiosity about how things work — whether it’s technology, design, or the creative process behind building something from scratch. He doesn’t chase shortcuts or surface-level answers; he digs until he truly understands. This mindset defines not only his work but also his approach to growth. Every challenge, mistake, or criticism becomes data — a chance to refine, learn, and come back sharper. Amit isn’t motivated by praise; he’s motivated by progress, precision, and mastery.</p>
    <p>Professionally, Amit combines technical skill with a creative mindset. Whether he’s exploring software development, 3D modeling, or digital design, his focus is on making things that feel real — not just functionally sound but visually and emotionally impactful. He’s a perfectionist in the sense that he cares about the smallest details — not out of vanity, but because he believes every detail shapes the final outcome. His work ethic is straightforward: do it right, or don’t do it at all. He thrives on solving problems others avoid, and he’s never afraid to start over if it means getting closer to excellence.</p>
    <p>At his core, Amit is honest, independent, and relentless. He doesn’t follow trends or copy what’s popular; he builds his own path. He values direct feedback, meaningful conversations, and people who challenge him to think harder. His mindset is simple — truth over comfort, growth over ego, and creation over consumption. For him, success isn’t about being better than others; it’s about becoming better than yesterday.</p>
