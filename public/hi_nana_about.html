<p>Hi Nanna (2023) is a Telugu-language drama film directed by debutant Shouryuv, starring Nani and Mrunal Thakur in lead roles, with Kiara Khanna portraying their daughter Mahi. The film centers on a single father, Viraj, who narrates the story of his missing wife to his daughter, exploring themes of love, parenthood, and resilience against a backdrop of scenic locations like Coonoor and Goa.<br>
 While the film received mixed reviews, it is generally praised for its emotional depth, strong performances—particularly from Nani and Mrunal Thakur—and its visually stunning cinematography.</p>
<ul>
    <li>The film's narrative follows Viraj, a celebrated photographer in Mumbai, as he navigates single parenthood after his wife Varsha (Mrunal Thakur) goes missing, while their daughter Mahi battles a life-threatening lung condition.</li>
    <li>Critics highlight the powerful emotional core, with the climax being especially impactful and praised for its writing and performances, elevating the film despite its slow pacing and predictable elements.</li>
    <li>Nani's performance is lauded for its depth, particularly in the final act, where he delivers a touching portrayal of a father's love and grief.</li>
    <li>Mrunal Thakur's role as Yashna, a character tied to Viraj's past, is described as the heart and soul of the film, with her screen presence and beauty noted as captivating.</li>
    <li>The film's technical aspects, including Hesham Abdul Wahab's background score, Sanu John Varghese's cinematography, and Praveen Anthony's editing, are widely appreciated for enhancing the emotional narrative.</li>
    <li>However, some reviews criticize the film for its slow pacing, predictable romantic storyline, underdeveloped supporting characters, and the inclusion of certain sequences—like the "Odiyamma" song—that disrupt the narrative flow.</li>
    <li>The film's structure is seen as strong in the first half, with a compelling setup and an effective interval twist, but the second half is considered to drag, with repetitive scenes and a lack of fresh developments.</li>
    <li>Despite its flaws, Hi Nanna is recommended for audiences seeking a heartfelt, family-oriented drama, with its emotional resonance and performances making it a worthwhile watch.</li>
