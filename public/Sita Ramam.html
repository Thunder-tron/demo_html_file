    <p>Sita Ramam (2022) is a period romance directed by Hanu Raghavapudi, starring Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur in the lead roles, with Rashmika Mandanna playing a pivotal supporting character.
 The film received generally positive reviews, with a consensus that it is a poetic, emotionally resonant love story that successfully blends romance, patriotism, and historical context, though it is often noted for its slow pacing and length.
 The film is set across two timelines—1964 and 1984—and follows the journey of Lieutenant Ram, an Indian Army officer, and Sita Mahalakshmi, a woman he falls in love with through a series of letters, while also exploring the mission of Afreen, a Pakistani student tasked with delivering a long-lost letter.</p>

<p>The performances, particularly by Dulquer Salmaan and Mrunal Thakur, were widely praised for their charm and emotional depth, with critics noting that Salmaan embodies the role of a gentle, innocent romantic hero, while Thakur made a strong Telugu debut with poise and vulnerability.
 Rashmika Mandanna’s portrayal of Afreen was also highlighted as a standout, with her character arc from prejudice to empathy serving as a narrative device to explore themes of humanity, love, and national identity.
 The film’s technical aspects—cinematography, production design, costumes, and music—were consistently lauded for their visual beauty and authenticity, especially the depiction of Kashmir’s landscapes and the retro aesthetic of the 1960s.</p>

<p>Despite its strengths, the film faced criticism for its pacing, particularly in the first half, which some reviewers found slow and overly drawn out.
 The screenplay was noted for its predictable elements and occasional logical inconsistencies, such as characters appearing unchanged after two decades.
 The inclusion of songs, while enhancing the romantic mood, was seen by some as disruptive to the narrative flow, contributing to the film’s lengthy runtime of 160 minutes.
 A few critics also pointed to the film’s heavy reliance on familiar tropes reminiscent of classic Yash Chopra-era romances like Veer-Zaara, which, while nostalgic, may not appeal to all audiences.</p>
